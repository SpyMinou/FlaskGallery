# FlaskGallery
this is a simple gallery app made with the framework flask, to upload and see the images you inserted in the database from your device.
to run this app, you have to run the python server.py file, once the server started you can connect to the app, add and see the previous added pictures,
you can add other files but that will provide an error or the html file wouldnt be able to read the file, the request that was built is for sending images and retrieving them as a files of bytes, 
then generating them in the html file.
